Spantree version 1.0
Dr. Robert E. Jamison
Paul Brannan

To make the binaries:
	1) make clean
	2) make dep
	3) make

To test the binaries:
	1) ./biname_test
	2) ./tree_test
	3) ./graph_test
	4) ./spantree_test

To use the software, type:
	./spantree inputfile
where inputfile is the name of the input file.  Alternately, you can type:
	./spantree inputfile outputfile
to write all the output to file outputfile.

To create an input file, use your favorite editor (vi, pico, nedit, etc.).
The format of the input file is as follows:
e1v1 e1v2
e2v1 e2v2
e3v1 e3v2
...

Where e1v1 is vertex 1 of edge 1, etc.  A sample input file sample.in has been
provided.  Note that the smallest vertex in this file is 0; you can start
with 1 instead, if you wish; the file sample2.in is arranged this way.

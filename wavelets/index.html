<p>This is my page on wavelets, which are neat little functions that oscillate and do really neat things.

<p>Click <a href="./wavelets.wpd">here</a> to read my paper that I wrote on lossless wavelet-based image compression (WordPerfet for Windows format).

<p>In the document, I discuss the test images that I used; to download those, click on one of the following:

<p><a href="./test1.zip">Test set 1</a><br>
<a href="./test2.zip">Test set 2</a><br>
<a href="./test3.zip">Test set 3</a><br>
<a href="./test4.zip">Test set 4</a><br>

<p>You may also click <a href="http://cscene.oftheinter.net/CS2/CS2-11.html">here</a> to see an article I wrote on wavelets for an electronic magazine called <a href="http://cscene.oftheinter.net/">CScene</a>.  It is based on the paper, but is probably a little easier to follow.

{\plain \tab "The man of the nineteenth century did not disbelieve in the Resurrection because his liberal 
Christianity allowed him to doubt it.  He disbelieved in it because his very strict materialism did not 
allow him to believe it.  Tennyson, a very typical nineteenth century man, uttered one of the instinctive 
truisms of his contemporaries when he said that there was faith in their honest doubt.  There was 
indeed.  Those words have a profound and even a horrible truth."  It was Gilbert Keith Chesterton who 
wrote these words trying to describe why, in his time, disbelief in the supernatural and in miracles were 
considered to be a liberal philosophy.  "In their doubt of miracles there was a faith in a fixed and 
godless fate; a deep and sincere faith in the incurable routine of the cosmos.  The doubts of the agnostic 
were only the dogmas of the monist."\par
}{\plain \tab Chesterton, a modernist philosopher, was correct in his interpretation of the waning of religious 
faith in the nineteenth century.  Tennyson, in his work }{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain , said that "there lives more faith in 
honest doubt than in half the creeds."  While Matthew Arnold saw faith as something which 
disappeared because "miracles do not happen," Tennyson saw a new kind of faith, one which relied 
more on doubt than dogma.\par

{\plain \tab There is today, and there was in the nineteenth century, a disagreement on exactly what the 
nature of faith is.  The author of Hebrews said that "faith is being sure of what we hope for, and certain 
of what we do not see."  It is this traditional view of faith that has caused such disagreement, that along 
with faith there must be some certainty, and that certainty implies that 1)\~there can be no doubt, and 
}{\plain 2)\~faith and reason are in opposition.  This is the view of faith that both Arnold and Tennyson hoped 
transcend. \par
}{\plain \tab Tennyson described faith as something which, rather than being in opposition to reason, is in 
opposition to knowledge.  He said of faith,\par
}\pard 
{\plain \tab We have but faith: we cannot know;\par
}{\plain \tab   For knowledge is of things we see;\par
}{\plain \tab   And yet we trust it comes from thee,\par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \tab A beam in darkness: let it grow. (}{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain , 21\_25)\par
}{\plain Tennyson's claim is that faith is a certainty of what we do not know.  He also claimed that faith does not 
preclude doubt, as his lover would have him believe, but rather that faith goes hand in hand with doubt.  
Moreover, it is doubt that brings about our certainty:\par
}\pard 
{\plain \tab Perplext in faith, but pure in deeds,\par
}{\plain \tab   At last he beat his music out.\par
}{\plain \tab   There lives more faith in honest doubt,\par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \tab Believe me, than in half the creeds. (}{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain  XCVI, 13\_16)\par
}{\plain \tab Arnold holds a similar view, that while traditionally having faith is "to take on trust what 
perplexes the reason," a more correct view is that "faith, instead of being a submission of the reason to 
what puzzles it, is rather a recognition of what is perfectly clear, if we will attend to it"  (}{\plain \i Literature and 
Dogma}{\plain , ch. VII).  This is a little different from Tennyson's view, as Tennyson does not make the claim 
that faith is of something which is necessarily clear.  This is the ultimate difference between Arnold and 
Tennyson: Tennyson holds that faith is of things we cannot know (that is, things which "perplex the 
reason"), while Arnold holds that faith must be of things which can be reasoned out, otherwise faith will 
invariable lead to ludicrous conclusions.  One of these ludicrous conclusions, according to Arnold, is the 
belief that there is such a thing as a miracle; rather, "miracles do not happen," and so to have faith in a 
miracle is to have faith in nothing.\par
}{\plain \tab One of the verses in }{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain  is about a married couple who loved each other so much 
they look only to each other and not to what "the faithless people say."  It is one of Tennyson's physical 
examples of what he believes it means to have faith.  It is an example from real life, an ideal nineteenth 
century scene:\par
}\pard 
{\plain \tab Her faith is fixt and cannot move,\par
}{\plain \tab   She darkly feels him great and wise,\par
}{\plain \tab   She dwells on him with faithful eyes,\par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \tab "I cannot understand: I love." (}{\plain \i In Memoriam }{\plain XCVII, 33-37)\par
}{\plain This woman does not understand knowledge, or of anything her husband knows, but she loves her 
husband nevertheless.  It is her lack of knowledge which gives her faith.  She is a perfect metaphor for 
the Christian church \'96 Christ as the husband and she as the Church.  While God understands so much 
more than we can ever possibly know, just like the woman, it is because of this that we love.\par
}{\plain \tab Arnold, however, gives a different view of faith in the nineteenth century.  He speaks of the 
Athanasian Creed, of clergy and the "sentence by sentence" enumeration of perplexing beliefs that they 
proclaim.  "We see how wide of the mark is that metaphysical clergymen... in imagining that... Jesus had 
in view anything at all like the 'facts' which the Athanasian Creed 'arranges, sentence after sentence.'"  It 
is this Creed, which does not and cannot capture the essence of Christ, which has cast darkness upon 
society.\par
}{\plain \tab Peter wrote in his letter, "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and 
precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.'  Now to you who 
believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, 'The stone the builders rejected has 
become the capstone,' and, 'A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.'  
According to Arnold, "Peter proving his Master's Messiahship from a Psalm that does not prove it,... 
foresaw the growth of creeds, the growth of dogma, and so through all the confusion worse confounded 
of councils, schoolmen, and confessions of faith, down to our own two bishops bent on 'doing 
something' for the honour of the Godhead of the Eternal Son!"  Arnold almost makes the traditional 
faith seem evil, though it is not the faith itself which is evil, but the dogma upon which the faith is built.\par
}{\plain \tab Tennyson questions faith, asking whether faith should lead to an answer, or whether an answer 
should lead to faith.  To Arnold, to make a claim that faith can lead to an answer, would be 
unreasonable.  On the other hand, there is something poetic about faith in things unseen:\par
}\pard 
{\plain \tab Is faith as vague as all unsweet:\par
}{\plain \tab   Eternal form shall still divide\par
}{\plain \tab   The eternal soul from all beside;\par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \tab And I shall know him when we meet: (}{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain  XLVII, 5\_8)\par
}{\plain \tab Arnold claims that it is exactly this sort of faith that is prevalent in the nineteenth century.  "The 
unlettered believer is, in fact, \'96 according to this version of what the Bible means to say, \'96 represented 
in the Bible as a better judge about a thing than which perplexes the reason than the philosopher."  He 
goes on to say, "these happy men are supposed to have, by faith, a certainty in matters perplexing in the 
highest degree to the reason, which the vaunted exercise of the reason can never attain to."\par
}{\plain \tab It is the book of John which Arnold sites in his claims against this view of faith.  "... how could 
Christ say to the Jews: 'If I tell you the truth, why do ye not believe me?'  Surely this implies that faith, 
instead of being a submission of the reason to what puzzles it, is rather a recognition of what is perfectly 
clear, if we will }{\plain \i attend}{\plain  to it."  The point that Arnold is making is that rather than basing our beliefs on 
dogma, as was common in his time, we should base our beliefs on the truth.\par
}{\plain \tab This system of finding the truth, generally through deductive reasoning, then basing faith on this 
newfound truth, is a great method, provided that there is a reasonable basis step and line of logic which 
can lead to the truth.  Unfortunately, this is not true in the case of a mystery, and thus it is no wonder 
that Arnold was an agnostic.  Tennyson, however, understood the true nature of faith:\par
}\pard 
{\plain \tab I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,\par
}{\plain \tab   And gather dust and chaff, and call\par
}{\plain \tab   To what I feel is Lord of all,\par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \tab And faintly trust the larger hope. (}{\plain \i In Memoriam}{\plain  LV, 17\_20)\par
}{\plain To Tennyson, faith is about finding a solution to these mysteries.  If "faith is being sure of what we hope 
for," then surely it is that hope in which we must trust; we cannot be forever skeptics, otherwise what 
conclusion can we ever hope to find?  Faith provides us a certainty in "things we do not see," and it is 
that certainty that the skeptic lacks.  It is for the same reason that the Lady of Shalott cannot look out 
the window that the skeptic cannot accept a truth \_\_ for fear of a curse, in this case, the curse of having 
to accept a certainty.  Even in spite of the consequences, I think I will choose the certainty.\par

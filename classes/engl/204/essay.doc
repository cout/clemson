{\plain \tab Software engineering is a big deal.  Developing a program is a large task, and as the program 
gets larger, managing the development becomes extremely difficult.  For this reason, many companies 
employ a process by which programs can be created.\par
}{\plain \tab In our software engineering class, we used a three-step process: requirements, design, and 
implementation.  Though the implementation step was never actually completed, it should in theory be a 
relatively insignificant piece of development.  A good design, which stems from a good requirements 
specification, aids in the task of maintenance and prevents problems in the implementation stage which 
might otherwise be prevalent.\par
}{\plain \tab To make our semester-long project more manageable, the class was divided into four teams.  
In a real company, it would not be inconceivable to have teams much larger than eight people, though a 
smaller team is certainly much easier to manage.  Companies like Microsoft divide into a hierarchical 
system, so that coding and design tasks are handed down the line in an efficient manner.\par
}{\plain \tab In our case, a team of eight seemed almost unwieldy at first; though each person was assigned a 
task, ensuring that all the tasks got done was not exactly easy.  As the semester went on, the team 
arose to the true meaning of the word.  We grew closer and got to know each other better, and felt 
more comfortable confronting the more vocal members of the group.  The team did, as teams are 
supposed to, work as a single entity.\par
}{\plain \tab This is not to say that our team was without troubles.  Though our original team leader was 
unable to attend many meetings later in the semester, we found it was still useful to have one person 
guide the meetings and keep everyone on track.  Our more productive weeks were also accompanied 
by an email to the group mailing list outlining exactly what was expected to be finished at the next 
meeting.\par
}{\plain \tab In addition, we also found that the majority is not always right.  The most vocal member of the 
group is generally not right.  On multiple occasions Shane had to correct me for trying to be too specific 
in the requirements specification, or keep me from imposing my warped view of how a subsystem 
should be designed on the person who was actually in charge of that subsystem.\par
}{\plain \tab Teamwork really isn\'92t that difficult, but it is important to remember that each member of the 
group is a real person and deserves to be treated with respect as such.  In any technical profession, it is 
easy to become arrogant and defensive when challenged; though our group was quick to cool down at 
such times, we did have many ego-related experiences.  To save the team\'92s sanity, ego must be one of 
the first things to go.\par

}{\plain \tab The project we were assigned was to design a calendar system.  We began the project by 
researching how a calendar system should or might be designed.  Part of this included interviewing our 
client (Rakesh) to determine what features should be included in the system.  Other forms of research 
included searching the Internet, and examining existing calendar systems to see what works.\par
}{\plain \tab Before the interview could be completed, interview questions had to be developed.  Because 
our client didn\'92t have many specific features in mind, the questions on the interview had to be very 
specific.  This probably influenced our design, as the questions generally entailed some variation of our 
preconceived ideas of what a calendar system is.  Whether this is for the better or the worse is difficult 
to say; it is certain, however, that the questions probably had the same effect as \'93leading the witness,\'94 
that is, the questions had the psychological effect of placing ideas into the heads of those answering 
them.\par
}{\plain \tab People involved in answering the interview questions included Rakesh, as well as IT personnel 
from the Medical University, and some doctors from a local hospital.  The fact that we had such a large 
percentage of input from the medical profession did not appear to greatly influence our results, though 
this is certainly conceivable.\par
}{\plain \tab Since many of us did already have ideas on how a calendar system should be designed, even as 
early as the research phase, we may have imposed these ideas on the requirements phase, which 
greatly limited the design phase.  In addition, the fact that each of us had differing ideas (as well as 
differing backgrounds and programming experience) on the proper design showed itself in the form of 
inconsistencies in the requirements and final design.\par

{\plain Discuss (and provide examples of) the types of errors caught by your SRS review. Why do you 
think these problems weren't picked up earlier? How did these errors affect Phase 2? (10 
marks)\par
}\pard \sl287 
{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab To address these inconsistencies, we had each team member pair up with another team 
member to review the SRS.  Most of the problems weren\'92t picked up earlier due to lack of 
communication and lack of any sort of general understanding of exactly where we were going with the 
process.  Most of us, in fact, were so caught up in the process that it was difficult to actually produce 
meaningful output.\par
}{\plain \tab One of the largest inconsistencies was a differing opinion on the use of the terms \'93client,\'94 
\'93server,\'94 and \'93system.\'94  Because most of the evaluated calendar systems were of a client-server 
architecture, it was certainly tempting to use such terms, especially for the more Unix-oriented team 
members.  However, there was also a large number of Novell-oriented team members; this caused 
great clashing over the use of \'93password server\'94 and \'93directory server.\'94  For this reason, we chose to 
limit ourselves to the more broad term \'93system.\'94  Unfortunately, not all references to \'93client\'94 and 
\'93server\'94 were removed from the first version of the requirements document.\par
}{\plain \tab The plan was to switch to a client-server architecture for the design phase.  However, since 
most of the use cases in the final requirements document were either ambiguous or oriented toward a 
unified architecture, the design specification became highly inconsistent.\par
}{\plain \tab We also found differences in data types and sizes between use cases.  Some of this was due to 
a disagreement over whether strings should necessarily be limited to a specific size.  Some of these 
differences were caught at the SRS review, but most of them were addressed later, during the beginning 
of the design phase.\par

{\plain The SRS and the SDS both contain use cases. What are the differences between these two 
documents, and why do they occur? (5 marks) \par
}\pard \sl287 
{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab It was during this design phase that the architecture of the system really began to become 
apparent.  For some of us, this was a great release, as the design specification is supposed to be more 
of a programmer\'92s guide than a specification meant for less competent eyes.  To put it simply, the 
requirements specification was a document that had two purposes: firstly, to set in stone the guidelines 
for what features must be met by the system, and in a way that the client can understand and provide 
feedback.  The second purpose of the requirements specification was to provide a general outline and 
description of the design of the system.\par
}{\plain \tab On the other hand, the design specification is designed for programmers and other technically-oriented people.  The requirements specification was used as a base for the design specification, but the 
design specification was much more highly detailed, and included references to many technical terms 
and data/algorithmic representations.\par
}{\plain \tab In the requirements specification, use cases were used to explain the steps in a single operation 
or type of operation.  The uses cases provide information on how important each operation is to the 
completeness of the system.  They also include other elements that describe where the operations they 
describe fit into the system.\par
}{\plain \tab The design specification takes this one step further and divides the use cases into functions and 
subroutines that would actually be written to correctly implement the system.  For example, while in the 
requirements specification the \'93set preferences\'94 sent its data to the \'93system,\'94 in the design specification 
the same use case simply called a subroutine which passed the data to a server, which ensured that the 
user was properly validated and saved the data in a database.\par

}{\plain \tab While the design specification is certainly specific enough to implement the system, it is not 
enough.  A review of the SDS similar to the review that was held for the SRS would be necessary to 
ensure completeness, correctness, and consistency.  As it stands, our current design specification is 
lacking in all of these.\par
}{\plain \tab Completeness is missing in that certain features that are claimed in the requirements 
specification are not entirely described.  For example, the requirements specification mentions that the 
system should be implemented using a client-server architecture, but it doesn\'92t mention any details.  The 
design specification uses a client-server architecture for the calendar database and the user database, 
but doesn\'92t provide any mechanism by which the client and server interact, nor are there functions on 
both the client side and the server side for sending and receiving the data that a single use case may 
take care of.\par
}{\plain \tab Correctness is missing in that the system implemented from our design would probably be 
entirely unacceptable to a real customer.  The user interface is lacking and is more procedural-oriented 
than object-oriented or event-driven; most applications today allow concurrent operations not 
supported by our design.  In addition, there are even such problems as the user preferences existing but 
rarely, if ever, being used by other use cases.  A correct system would address these issues and others 
that might be present in the design.\par
}{\plain \tab Lastly, consistency is also missing.  In some cases, the design specification does not match the 
requirements specification.  This is sometimes due to an update in system architecture, but other times 
due to a change that was not intended to be made.  In addition, certain use cases do not necessarily 
interact in the way prescribed by the original requirements; the most obvious in this case is meeting 
proposals and checking for proposed meetings.  Since three different people were developing the use 
cases for these operations, consistency is lacking, and would be addressed in a formal SDS review.}}

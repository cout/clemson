\section{Executive Summary}


\section{Introduction}

I'm having a hard time getting inspired to write this introduction. Suffice
it to say that the purpose is to compare three potential jobs. The scope is
limited, as I will only be comparing qualities of each job that are easily accessible
to me, and I will not be considering any of these jobs as life-long positions.

As I do not yet have any conclusions, I cannot place any in my introduction.
I will place them here at a later time.


\section{Methods}

To complete this job comparison, I researched information on three different
companies. This information was gathered from three sources:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each company's web page
\item Entering the company's name into search engine (namely, google.com)
\item Clemson Career Center (not yet)
\end{enumerate}
Some basic categories were considered:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Job requirements
\item Expected benefits
\item Expected costs
\item Other pertinent information
\end{enumerate}

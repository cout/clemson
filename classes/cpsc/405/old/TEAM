Assignment 1

This assignment was an exercise in GUI design and basic 3D object manipluation
techniques.  The interface was implmented in Glade/GTK+, and the graphics
code was implemented using GTK glarea, and OpenGL.  

The program will read simple 3D objects (i.e. Alias|Wavefront polygonal
object files), has user-adjustable face and normal display, provides
interactive control for object, camera, and scene transformations, and
implements hidden surface removal that matches the surface removal used by
OpenGL.  This was tested by using OpenGL face culling, and comparing results
to the home-brewed hidden surface removal.

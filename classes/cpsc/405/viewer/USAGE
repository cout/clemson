The menu bar is at the top, the toolbar below that, and the controls and
orientation display are at the right.  The black box in the middle is the
view window, and the yellow bars you see are your axes.  The bar at the
bottom is the status bar, which will display important information
throughout your use of the program.

To start off, load an object.  This can be done by selecting either File...Load
or by clicking on the Load icon.  Highlight the file you wish to load, and
select okay.

You have many options for manipulating the camera, object, and scene.  This is
all done using the notepad at the upper right of the window.  You can select
which mouse buttons perform which functions.  Only the left buttons and middle
buttons are remappable, however, since the right mouse button is reserved for
future use.  Use the arrows in the corner of the notebook to "flip through" the
pages to get different options for manipulations.  Your options include:
  - Rotate eye: this will rotate the camera about its current position
  - Zoom eye: this will translate the camera forward and backward.
  - Roll eye: this will "roll" the camera to the left and to the right
  - Rotate object: this will rotate an object about its center
  - Move XZ object: this will move an object along the scene's XZ axis
  - Move XY object: this will move an object along the scene's XY axis
  - Rotate scen: this will rotate the entire scene and it's axes about the
    origin.

Use the above objects by selecting an option and clicking and dragging the
mouse in the view window.  Note that as the axes of the scene move, so do
the axes of the orientation view.  This allows you to determine which way
your scene is tilted, even when the axes are out of view.

If you load multiple objects, you can manipulate different objects by
selecting different objects.  This is done with either +/- or ] and [.
Currently there is no point-and-click object selection implemented.  You
can tell which object is currently selected, because it's vertices will be
drawn in green.  If there is no object selected, all objects will be drawn
in white.

There are also many options for viewing the scene.  All these are selected
from the options menu.  Available options include:
  - Wireframe on/off: switches between wireframe and solid view
  - Axes on/off: turns the yellow axes on and off
  - Hidden surface removal: the home-brewed way
  - Hidden surface removal: the OpenGL way
  - Face normals on/off: turns face normals on and off
  - Vertex normals on/off: turns vertex normals on and off
  - Lighting on/off: turns lighting on and off

Additionally, there are a few options for manipulating objects.  These are
available from the object menu.  Included among these are:
  - Invert normals (not yet automatic)
  - Object color
  - Bind texture (doesn't work with gif files, only handles some jpgs)
  - Select object - gives you a hand pointer to select an object onscreen
  - Create curved model - brings up a dialog from which splines and curved
    models can be created.
  - Save object - save the object to disk.

Once you have loaded an object and have turned normals on, you can manipulate
the size of the normals using the scales at the right center.  Image scale
changes the scale of the entire scene.  Face normal scale and vertex normal
scale change the scale of the face and vertex normals, respectively.  The
default scale is 1.0.

To create a curved model, select Object..Create curved model.  Control points
can be created simply by clicking on the grid; already existing points can
be moved by clicking and dragging them around with the mouse.  To see what
spline curve the control points represent, click on the "show spline curve"
button.  To create a 3D model by rotation, click on the "sweep" button.
Note that this will erase the currently selected object and replace it with
the new 3D model; to avoid this, deselect the currently selected object with
the object selection feature (select a black space on the screen), or use the
+/- keys.

Also note that to save an object, you must use the Object..save object menu
item, as the File...Save menu is for scenes, and scene files have not yet
been implemented.

To create a particle system, do the following:
	1) Go to the particle system menu, and select "Settings".
	2) Turn on or off all the settings you want
	3) Load one or more objects as described above.
	4) Click on the Animate button on the toolbar to start the system.
	5) The stop button will pause the system
	6) The reset button will mark all particles as dead so that they
	   will reappear at the position specified in the settings dialog.

Note that the system is not a perfect system, but uses approximations in
order to gain a little bit of speed.  There are no bounding boxes or bounding
spheres, as these sacrifice far too much accuracy for a small amount of
speed.  If this project were to be fully completed, the octtree code in
misc/blocklist.c would be implemented.

That should just about do it; anything else should be roughly self
explanatory.  Have fun!

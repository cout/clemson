1) A nop is used so that no instruction will be executed after the branch
   instruction.  Code can be optimized by replacing the nop with the
   instruction preceding the branch.
2) majority of instructions composed of ALU operations
3) 000000 to 111111
4) 2^29-1
5) a - add R8, R24, R16
   b - st R16, R30, 0x00001FE8
   c - jmpl R0, R31, 0x00000008

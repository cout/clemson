1) foo is essentially the same as strcpy (though it doesn't copy the null
   terminator).

2)
#include <stdio.h>
main() {
	char s[81]; int j;
	for(j = !0;;j = !j) {
		gets(s, sizeof(s));
		if(j) puts(s);
	}
}

3)
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=
CLIBS=

all: test

test: test.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CLIBS) test.c -o test

4) okay.

5) 4 bytes always -- reduces complexity of instruction decoding.

6) ld/st

1) SPARC pipeline - fetch instruction, fetch operands, ALU operation, memory
                    access, register write
   WINDLX pipeline - instruction fetch, instruction decode, instruction execute,
                     memory access, write back
   There are no real differences between the two pipelines.  Instruction fetch
   loads the instruction.  Instruction decode fetches the operatnds.
   Instruction execute executes the instruction, which is the same as an ALU
   operation.  Memory access write the result of the instruction to memory or
   sometimes may read from memory or do nothing.  Write back is the same as
   register write.

2) The brown arrows indicate stalls due to hazards and the green arrows indicate
   forwarding of execution due to previous stalls.

It appears that the buffer size doesn't make too much of a difference unless
it gets really small.  The times shown are the lowest times of multiple
trials.  On each trial, the number 2048 seemed to be the key, possibly because
of the small L1 cache on the 486 (this buffer size would allow itself, the
program loop, and some networking code to stay in the cache without much
swapping).  Anything larger seems to give the same result.  MMAP is just slow
for this operation, period.

System: AMD K6/200 (rev. 1), RedHat Linux 5.2, Kernel 2.2.0

The optimal time here is roughly 2048 bytes, twice as large as for the 486.
This is still not equal to the Linux page size (4096 bytes).  Cache shouldn't
be a big factor here, since the K6 has 32k L1 cache; however, since other
programs were running in the background (irc, lynx, ftp), this could have
reduced the effective cache size.  MMAP is still slow, but the difference
is much smaller, possibly due to increased efficiency of the VMM in the new
kernel, though this is merely speculation since the hardware is different.

CPSC 360 BTree Assignment
Report 2

Changes to DBFile class: none

Changes to BTreeNode class:
	Added constructor, destructor.  Possible parameters are number of
		elements, size, and a buffer (to avoid a copy if the data
		is already in memory).
	Added isLeafNode, which is a pointer to an int.  The entire node is
		stored in one buffer, with various elements pointing to
		pieces of the buffer.  The start of the buffer is at
		elementList.
	Added NodeSize(), which calculates the number of bytes required to
		store the BTree.  This is useful both for memory allocation
		and writing to disk.
	Added nextLeaf, which was left out of the project design
		inadvertently.
	Added getbuf(), which returns a pointer to the start of the buffer.
		This is useful for reading/writing the node to/from disk
		without performing unnecessary memory allocations.

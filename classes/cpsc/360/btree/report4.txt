CPSC 360 BTree Assignment
Report 3

Changes to DBFile class:
	Uses FileBuffer to cache data.  There should be a way to return
	this information to the calling program to make searching even
	faster (search the nodes in memory first).

Changes to BTreeNode class:
	Uses blockman as a block manager

Changes to BTree class:
	Uses blockman as a block manager
	Added check for index=0 as an error condition

Added BTreeDB class
Added SecondaryIndex class
Added main.cpp

Known defects:
	Some problem in test.cpp relating to non-unique keys.  This problem
	is extraordinarily rare and depends heavily on the random number
	generator.

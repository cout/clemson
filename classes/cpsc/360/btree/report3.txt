CPSC 360 BTree Assignment
Report 3

Changes to DBFile class: none

Changes to BTreeNode class:
	Added setNextLeaf() to set the "next" pointer.  Should this be used
		for index nodes as well as leaf nodes?
	Made NodeSize() public -- this is necessary for reading/writing
		straight to a file
	Added doSplit() -- performs a split, takes a BTreeNode reference
		as an argument
	Added findElementIndex() -- this is called by insertElement and
		searchForElement.
	
Changes to BTreeDB class:
	Implemented insertRecord for a BTree (not for B+)
	Implemented deleteRecord for a BTree (not for B+)
	Implemented findRecord for a BTree (should be the same as for B+)
	Added a stack of indexes -- useful in insertion (deletion too?)

Notes:
	The BTreeDB class has not been tested.  It probably doesn't work
	quite right yet; what's not working is insert/delete, which haven't
	yet been completely implemented.  Search should work just fine,
	but can't be tested without insert.

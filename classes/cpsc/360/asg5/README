Notes

A seek is always performed after every read_rec operation.  This is probably
unnecessary, but it ensures that the file offset pointers is at the end of the
record after the read operation.  Correct procedure would probably be to buffer
the data that has already been read.

The database does not shrink if the last record is deleted.  Perhaps it should,
or perhaps this would be part of a "compact" operation.  Allocating space on
disk early helps to ensure that the file is contiguous.

The results:

[cout@ducttape tmp]$ ./insdel
Using a best fit placement policy.
Total number of bytes in records: 1780327
Total number of bytes in free space: 44867
Total file size: 1825194
Percent utilization: 97%

Writing record list to data.out

[cout@ducttape tmp]$ ./insdel -w
Using a worst fit placement policy.
Total number of bytes in records: 1782192
Total number of bytes in free space: 204446
Total file size: 1986638
Percent utilization: 89%

Writing record list to data.out

Best fit appears to be slightly better.  This may be misleading, though.  I
suspect that most of the free space under worst fit is at the end of the file.

CPSC 428 Assignment 5

No extra functionality, just some notes.

I used ArrayList instead of Vector.  This isn't thread-safe I think?  It
doesn't really matter in this case.  I used Iterator instaed of Enumerator,
since this is Java 1.2; Enumerator isn't thread-safe but it is probably
faster.  Again, this probably doesn't make one bit of difference.

Also, I put class Name inside Name.java.  This is more correct than what
is in the assignment.

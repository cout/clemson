Some notes:

The name list uses multiple mode, so more than one name can be selected.
All selected items are processed when "Change class" or "Show Selection" is
clicked.

I've added a quit button, and a dialog box for messages.

The event handler is very unoptimized.  It is a long if-else chain.  I don't
see how to implement this correctly off the top; I suppose a hash table of
sorts would work, but this would be messy to implement on this simple
project.

Also, I get some interesting warnings:
Warning: 
    Cannot allocate colormap entry for default background
Warning: 
    Name: slist
    Class: XmList
    Invalid item(s) to delete.

They don't appear to affect operation.

Lastly, the window moves it self on startup.  I don't have a clue why.

I'm submitting Name.java again in case my classes don't work with yours.

The filename extensions are still wrong.  .c is for C programs.  C++ programs
should use .cc or .cpp.

What is the purpose in using a shell script to compile the programs?  I think
a Makefile would be much more appropriate (and it would be kind of nice for
students to get experience with Makefiles in the lab).

This was a very interesting lab (er, as interesting as a c++ lab could be...),
but I don't think I gained much from it in terms of what this course is for;
it seemed more like a tutorial in gnuplot than anything else.  The curve
fitting was inexact, and hardly scientific.  I think I could gain a quick
dislike for gnuplot.

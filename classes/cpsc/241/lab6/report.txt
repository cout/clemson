1) This is so multiple items can be output even if in >> D.NameComponent is
   false.

2) These symbols are spread across multiple files; CC has no way of knowing
   which of these files to check for multiple/undefined symbols.

3) i) there are no records with the same name
   ii) an external comparison routine is used to determine relationships
       between two records (just as with qsort in c)

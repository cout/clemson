   There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
Omitted, and all the rest of their lives are
bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat, and
we must take the current when it serves,
or we will lose our ventures.
	William Shakespeare

This assignment is being submitted late because I forgot to turn it in.  If
you check the timetamps, you will not see this since I did make a few
modifications today.

BTW, I put the "strip main" command in my Makefile which should remove a
lot of unnecessary code from the executable (reduces my main to 70k!)

Feeling pretty stupid right now,

Paul Brannan

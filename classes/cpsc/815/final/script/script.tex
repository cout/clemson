(fade-in) Chapter 18 (fade-out)

~

And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of

Gold~ continued~ on~ its~ way~ perfectly~ normally~ with a rather

fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and~ done

out~ in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a

spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray

of~ ferns~ and~ yellow~ flowers~ and~ next~ to it a stone sundial

pedestal housed the main computer~ terminal.~ Cunningly~ deployed

lighting~ and~ mirrors~ created~ the~ illusion~ of~ standing in a

conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely~ manicured

garden.~ Around~ the~ periphery~ of~ the~ conservatory area stood

marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron~ legs.

As~ you~ gazed~ into the polished surface of the marble the vague

forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them~ the

instruments~ materialized~ instantly~ under your hands. Looked at

from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect~ all~ the

required~ data~ readouts, though it was far from clear where they

were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful.

~

Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \char`\"{}What

the hell happened?\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}Well I was just saying,\char`\"{} said Arthur lounging by~ a~ small~
fish

pool,~ \char`\"{}there's this Improbability Drive switch over here ...\char`\"{}
he

waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now.

~

\char`\"{}But where are we?\char`\"{} said Ford~ who~ was~ sitting~ on~ the~
spiral

staircase,~ a~ nicely~ chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his

hand.

~

\char`\"{}Exactly where we were, I think ...\char`\"{} said Trillian, as all~
about

them~ the~ mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape

of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.

~

Zaphod leapt out of his seat.

~

\char`\"{}Then what's happened to the missiles?\char`\"{} he said.

~

A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.

~

\char`\"{}They would appear,\char`\"{} said Ford doubtfully, \char`\"{}to have
turned into a

bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale ...\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}At an Improbability Factor,\char`\"{} cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed~
a

bit, \char`\"{}of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one

hundred and twenty-eight to one against.\char`\"{}

~

Zaphod stared at Arthur.

~

\char`\"{}Did you think of that, Earthman?\char`\"{} he demanded.

~

\char`\"{}Well,\char`\"{} said Arthur, \char`\"{}all I did was ...\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}That's very good thinking you know. Turn~ on~ the~ Improbability

Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens.

Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that?\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}Oh,\char`\"{} said Arthur, \char`\"{}well, it was nothing really ...\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}Was it?\char`\"{} said Zaphod. \char`\"{}Oh well, forget it~ then.~
OK,~ computer,

take us in to land.\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}But ...\char`\"{}

~

\char`\"{}I said forget it.\char`\"{}

~

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact~ that~ against~ all

probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence

several miles above the surface of an alien planet.

~

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for~ a~ whale,

this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms

with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to~ terms

with not being a whale any more.

~

This is a complete record of its~ thoughts~ from~ the~ moment~ it

began its life till the moment it ended it.

~

Ah ... ! What's happening? it thought.

~

Er, excuse me, who am I?

~

Hello?

~

Why am I here? What's my purpose in life?

~

What do I mean by who am I?

~

Calm down, get~ a~ grip~ now~ ...~ oh!~ this~ is~ an~ interesting

sensation,~ what~ is~ it?~ It's~ a~ sort of ... yawning, tingling

sensation in my ... my~ ...~ well~ I~ suppose~ I'd~ better~ start

finding~ names~ for~ things if I want to make any headway in what

for the sake of what I shall call an argument I~ shall~ call~ the

world, so let's call it my stomach.

~

Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong.~ And~ hey,~ what's~ about

this~ whistling~ roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going

to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good

name?~ It'll do ... perhaps I can find a better name for it later

when I've found out what it's for.~ It~ must~ be~ something~ very

important~ because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of

it. Hey! What's this thing? This ... let's call it a tail - yeah,

tail.~ Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good can't I?

Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but

I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now - have I built

up any coherent picture of things yet?

~

No.

~

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so~ much~ to~ find~ out

about,~ so~ much~ to~ look~ forward~ to,~ I'm~ quite~ dizzy~ with

anticipation ...

~

Or is it the wind?

~

There really is a lot of that now isn't it?

~

And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards~ me~ very

fast?~ Very~ very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big

wide sounding name like ... ow ... ound~ ...~ round~ ...~ ground!

That's it! That's a good name - ground!

~

I wonder if it will be friends with me?

~

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.

~

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through~ the~ mind~ of

the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people

have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of~ petunias

had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the

universe than we do now.

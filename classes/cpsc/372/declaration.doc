\par I am an enrolled student in the topic CPSC372 - Introduction to Software Development. 
\par 
\par In Phase 1 of the project work for this topic, my contribution to the final document produced by my group was as}{\f0\fs24  }{\f0\fs24 follows: 
\par   
\par \tab I attended all of the meetings except one.  }{\f0\fs24 Unfortunately }{\f0\fs24 I failed to give an apology}{\f0\fs24 , though no one was upset with me because of that}{\f0\fs24 .  In the meeting discussions, I did my best to contribute to discussion at the meetings and give my input, even when this sparked argument between the Unix people and the Novell people (this eventually resulted in writing the SRS to be as system-independent as possible).  Outside of the meetings, Shane and I had many discussions that ended up coming up at the meetings.  Most of these were immediately following class.
\par \tab We all did our parts in contributing to the questionnaire, and I used the research I had from the Internet to write some questions.  The final questionnaire, compiled by Shane, I forwarded to a former co-worker at the Medical University.  He forwarded it to someone who had worked on researching and comparing various calendar systems already on the market.  The final response was forwarded to the group.
\par \tab I wrote the use cases for set/change user preferences, set/change user information, set/change password, and set/change system settings, as well as the introduction to the SRS.  For the use cases, I based them off the sample use case from the web page.  Most of the preferences came from the manual for Meeting Maker, an existing calendar system used by the College of Engineering and Sciences.  Shane proofread the use cases and the introduction, and I made the recommended modifications.  I also proofread Shane's cases, and Aibek's cases.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f0\fs24 \tab There were also four other use cases that I wrote for the User Information Subsystem that were not turned in with the final SRS document.  We decided that subsystems were a bit early to be starting, and also a bit too implementation-specific.

\par The sections of the submitted document identified above were written entirely by me. No part was obtained from other students (from either inside or outside my group), was jointly developed with other students (from either inside or outside my group) or was obtained from other sources (such as textbooks, documentation on other software systems, etc.), except where noted above or referenced in the appropriate section of the submitted document.
